/*
EVENT RECOGNITION LOOP

--- initialiseRecognition(+InputFlag, +PreProcessingFlag, +TemporalDistance).
InputFlag=ordered means that input facts are temporally sorted.
InputFlag=any_other_value means that input facts are not temporally sorted.
PreProcessingFlag=preprocessing means that there is a need for preprocessing by means of an application-dependent preProcessing/1. See the experiments on the CAVIAR dataset for an example of preprocessing.
PreProcessingFlag=any_other_value means that there is no need for preprocessing.
TemporalDistance is an integer denoting the distance between two consecutive time-points. Eg, in CAVIAR the temporal distance is 40.

Assert input facts at your leisure, even in a non-chronological manner. Then perform event recognition:
--- eventRecognition(+Qi, +WM).
where Qi is the current query time, and WM is the 'working memory'.

A NOTE ON THE LISTS THAT ARE USED IN THE CODE

-simpleFPList/sdFPList(Index, F=V, RestrictedList, Extension) where RestrictedList is the list of periods of the simple (statically determined) fluent within (Qi-WM, Qi] and Extension is the period before Qi-WM. Extension must be amalgamated with RestrictedList in order to produce the correct result of event recognition at Qi. F=V is an output entity.
-iePList(Index, F=V, RestrictedList, Extension) like above, except that F=V is an input entity.
-evTList: the time-points of output entity/event within (Qi-WM, Qi].

---RTEC PREDICATES---

The predicates below are available to the user:

-happensAt(E, T) represents the time-points T in which an event E occurs.
-happensAt(start(F=V), T) represents a special event which takes place at the starting points of the maximal intervals of F=V. Similarly for happensAt(end(F=V), T).
-initially(F=V) expresses that F=V at time 0.
-initiatedAt(F=V, _, T, _) states that at time T a period of time for which F=V is initiated.
-terminatedAt(F=V, _, T, _) states that at time T a period of time for which F=V is terminated.
-holdsFor(F=V, L) represents that the list of maximal intervals L during which F=V holds continuously.
-holdsAt(F=V, T) states that F=V holds at time-point T.

The predicates above are compiled into the following:

-happensAtIE(E, T) represents the time-points T in which an input entity/event E occurs.
-happensAtProcessedIE(start(U), T) represents the time-points in which a special event 'start' occurs. The special event takes place at the starting points of the input entity/statically determined fluent U. The intervals of U are cached.  Similarly for happensAtProcessedIE(end(U), T).
-happensAtProcessedSimpleFluent(start(U), T) represents the time-points in which a special event 'start' occurs. The special event takes place at the starting points of the simple fluent U. The intervals of U are cached. Similarly for happensAtProcessedSimpleFluent(end(U), T).
-happensAtProcessedSDFluent(start(U), T) represents the time-points in which a special event 'start' occurs. The special event takes place at the starting points of the output entity/statically determined fluent U. The intervals of U are cached. Similarly for happensAtProcessedSDFluent(end(U), T).
-happensAtProcessed(E, T) represents the cached time-points T in which an output entity/event E occurs. E is not a start() or end() event.
-happensAtEv(E, T) represents the definition of an output entity/event.
-happensAt(E, T) is used for user interaction.

-holdsForIESI(U, I) represents an interval I in which an input entity/statically determined fluent U occurs. Note that the second argument of this predicate is a single interval, as opposed to a list of intervals; underlying sensor data processing systems report single intervals as opposed to lists of intervals.
-holdsForProcessedIE(Index, IE, L) retrieves the cached list of intervals of an input entity/statically determined fluent.
-holdsForProcessedSimpleFluent(Index, F=V, L) retrieves the cached list of intervals of a simple fluent.
-holdsForProcessedSDFluent(Index, F=V, L) retrieves the cached list of intervals of an output entity/statically determined fluent.
-holdsForSDFluent(F=V, L) represents the definition of a durative output entity/statically determined fluent.
-holdsFor(F=V, L) is used for user interaction.

-holdsAtProcessedIE(Index, F=V, T) checks whether a processed input entity/statically determined fluent holds at a given time-point.
-holdsAtProcessedSDFluent(Index, F=V, T) checks whether a cached output entity/statically determined fluent holds at a given time-point.
-holdsAtProcessedSimpleFluent(Index, F=V, T) checks whether a cached simple fluent holds at a given time-point.
-holdsAtSDFluent(Index, F=V, T) checks whether a statically determined fluent holds at a given time-point. This predicate is used when the intervals F=V are not cached.
-holdsAt(F=V, T) is used for user interaction.

NOTE: statically determined fluents are defined only in terms of interval manipulation constructs, ie they are not defined by means of holdsAt.
NOTE: The second argument in holdsAtX query should be ground.

DECLARATIONS:

-event(E) states that E is an event.
-simpleFluent(F=V) states that F=V is a simple fluent.
-sDFluent(F=V) states that F=V is a statically determined fluent.

-inputEntity(U) represents the input entities (events and/or statically determined fluents).
-outputEntity(U) represents the composite entities (events, simple fluents and/or statically determined fluents).

-collectIntervals(F=V) states that the list of intervals of input entity/statically determined fluent F=V will be produced by the RTEC input module by collecting the reported individual intervals
-buildIntervals(F=V) states that the list of intervals of input entity/statically determined fluent F=V will be produced by the RTEC input module by gathering the reported time-points

-temporalDistance(TD) denotes the temporal distance between consecutive time-points. In some applications, such as video surveillance, there is a fixed temporal distance between time-points (video frames). In other applications this is not the case and therefore temporalDistance/1 should be undefined.

-cachingOrder(Index, U) denotes the order of entity (event or fluent) processing. The first argument is the index of the entity.
